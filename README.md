Since 2019, the blockchain industry has undergone earth-shaking changes, and distributed financial -- DeFi -- is rapidly emerging. Various types of assets locked in different DeFi protocols has exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars. With the continuous development of various on-chain assets and more and more off-chain assets going on-chain, we believe that the scale of assets locked in the DeFi protocol will soon exceed the market value of 100 billion U.S. dollars. These on-chain assets require a fast, frictionless, trust-free real-time exchange, which has led to the rise of new exchange protocols such as Uniswap.

Although the new DEX represented by Uniswap has achieved significant development, it still has obvious shortcomings. First: The gas fee of dozens of dollars at every turn hinders the entry of new users; Second: Every transaction and every operation needs to wait for at least one block to confirm, and the real-time performance is poor; Third: Subject to the Ethereum chain Due to the limitation of TPS, Uniswap has a clear ceiling on the number of transactions and transaction capacity that can be traded per second. The above three points are the pain points currently facing all DEX.

ZK-Rollup is a new type of Layer-2 expansion solution. Compared with other Layer-2 expansion solutions such as Plasma, ZK-Rollup has considerable advantages in terms of safety, economy, TPS, and usability. It is especially suitable for Build a Layer-2 decentralized exchange.

ZKSwap (ZK-Rollups based Swap) is a brand-new exchange protocol based on ZK-Rollups technology. Through Zk-Rollups technology, all ERC20 tokens are transferred to Layer2, and the consistent state of Layer1 and Layer2 is guaranteed based on continuously generated zero-knowledge proofs. This solution allows all exchanges to occur on Layer 2, achieving real-time swap with zero gas fees (no longer having to wait for a block confirmation time), unlimited scalability, getting rid of the Ethereum's TPS and block confirmation time restrictions. ZKSwap allows DEX to have the smooth experience of CEX (centralized exchange) while keeping the security of their funds simultaneously. We believe that ZKSwap is the future trading form, which will surely bring significant changes to all existing DEX and CEX.

At present, the ZKSwap team has finished most of the development work. We will release the exchange agreement for ZKSwap in early October. In the future, we will promote the DEX exchange standard on Layer-2, so that all existing DEXs can seamlessly access and use ZKSwap exchange protocol.
